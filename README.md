# Bluetooth car control application
The purpose of this project is creating a app that establishes a bluetooth connection to the BLE module of an arduino and controls its characteristics.

## Reason
I'm testing out my abilities and want to learn more about building physical devices hand in hand with software.

## Build project
1. Set correct service and characteristics UUID in BluetoothService class
2. Build project with gradle
3. Run on physical device

## Application
1. Activate bluetooth and location setting
2. Activate your programmed arduino
3. Give permissions within the app
4. Connect and test the characteristic changes
